## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Whisker

App: Discord
Features:

  - Connects me with others by sending messages and gifs

App: Google Photos
Features:
  - I can transfer photos via my computer and phone with ease
  - Can easily locate specific photos of people via face regonition

An app that I could like to design/improve would be an app for Florida International University. Currently the app logs you out and often crashes whenever I hit the "back" funtion on my phone. I think this is poor designing and would love to help deisgn a better interface that works with PantherSoft. Whenever this happens it also makes me go through the 2 factor authentication and doesn't save my previous log in, creating a poor user experience. I would enjoy creating a better experience for this so that users would be able to reliably use the app instead of having to go to the website.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I faced the challenge of opening the Adjust Editor Options with the Assistant and Control moving the button object into the ViewController class. After learning more about the Xcode IDE, I was able to overcome this challenge and successfully continue with the programming.
